# nv-center-network-analysis
Network Analysis of Correlated Quantum States in NV Centers

The project directory structure provides an organized way to manage and store your project's files and folders. Below is a recap of the proposed structure and an explanation of where and how to use it:

## Project Structure

```bash
    nv-center-network-analysis/
    ├── data/
    │   ├── raw/
    │   ├── processed/
    ├── notebooks/
    │   ├── data_analysis.ipynb
    │   ├── network_analysis.ipynb
    ├── scripts/
    │   ├── data_preprocessing.py
    │   ├── network_analysis.py
    ├── src/
    │   ├── utils.py
    │   ├── visualization.py
    ├── README.md
    ├── requirements.txt
    ├── .gitignore
```

## Explanation of Each Directory and File
data/: This directory contains subdirectories for raw and processed data files.

raw/: Store raw data files here.
processed/: Store processed data files here after cleaning and preprocessing.
notebooks/: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and network analysis.

data_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for initial data exploration and analysis.
network_analysis.ipynb: Jupyter notebook for analyzing network structures of NV centers.
scripts/: This directory contains standalone Python scripts for data preprocessing and network analysis.

data_preprocessing.py: Script to load, clean, and preprocess raw data.
network_analysis.py: Script to perform network analysis on the processed data.
src/: This directory contains reusable Python modules for utility functions and visualization.

utils.py: Module containing utility functions such as computing correlations and building networks.
visualization.py: Module containing functions for visualizing the network structures.
README.md: Markdown file providing an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage examples.

requirements.txt: Text file listing the project's dependencies that can be installed via pip.

.gitignore: Text file specifying files and directories to be ignored by git, such as temporary files, data files, and compiled code.

## How to Use the Directory Structure

**Setting Up the Project:**

Navigate to your project directory: cd nv-center-network-analysis
Create the directories and files as shown in the structure above.
Adding Content to Files:

Open the files in a text editor or IDE and add the code provided in the previous instructions.
Using the Scripts and Notebooks:

data_preprocessing.py: Run this script to load, clean, and preprocess your raw data.
network_analysis.py: Run this script to perform network analysis on the processed data.
data_analysis.ipynb and network_analysis.ipynb: Use these notebooks for interactive analysis and visualization.

**Installing Dependencies:**

Install the required Python packages using the ```requirements.txt``` file:

```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Version Control with Git:
```bash
    git init #Initialize a git repository if you haven't already: 
    git add . #Add files to the staging area:
    git commit -m "Initial commit with project structure and sample code" #Commit the changes 
    git push -u origin main #Push the changes to your GitHub repository:
```

Here are the commands to create directories and files using PowerShell, assuming you are in the root directory of your project:
```bash
    # Create directories
    mkdir data
    mkdir data\raw
    mkdir data\processed
    mkdir notebooks
    mkdir scripts
    mkdir src

    # Create empty files
    New-Item -Path . -Name "requirements.txt" -ItemType "file"
    New-Item -Path . -Name ".gitignore" -ItemType "file"
    New-Item -Path .\scripts\ -Name "data_preprocessing.py" -ItemType "file"
    New-Item -Path .\scripts\ -Name "network_analysis.py" -ItemType "file"
    New-Item -Path .\src\ -Name "utils.py" -ItemType "file"
    New-Item -Path .\src\ -Name "visualization.py" -ItemType "file"
    New-Item -Path .\notebooks\ -Name "data_analysis.ipynb" -ItemType "file"
    New-Item -Path .\notebooks\ -Name "network_analysis.ipynb" -ItemType "file"
```

By following these instructions, you will have a well-organized project structure that will help in managing your code, data, and analysis tasks efficiently.
